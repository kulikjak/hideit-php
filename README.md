# hideit-php

Very simple PHP code to encrypt PHP files while being able to run them encrypted anyway.

This is not a secure encryption method at all, but hey, its good enough if you want to hide the contents of your files saved on shared PHP server from your fellow students in high school.

Obviously, this does not prevent anybody from just deleting everything or by simply getting the encryption key from the session since they have physical access anyway, but it is better than nothing.
